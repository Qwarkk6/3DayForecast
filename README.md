# 3DayForecast

3DayForecast is a scriptable widget that takes the weather conditions and temperature forecast for the next 3 days (exlcuding the current day) and presents it as a simple medium sized widget with a transparent background.

The weather forecast is fetched from OpenWeatherMap and therefore requires you to have an api key set up with them.
